By wake I was tired as to be expected considering it is a common trend throughout my time here on earth. Unfortunately I decided to stay in bed for less than a single minute getting up resulting in my confinement to the smaller couch. By dawn I was already forced into going to what could be considered a volunteer testing lab, but truly that would give a negative connotation resulting in false imagery of what the place is truly like, so instead I will call it an inpatient study, which better suits what they are actually doing. I got my blood drawn (again) but this time it was more painful. It also may have bruised. Even as such, I do not care. I am helping people and getting money by doing so, and therefore have no qualms about the study. Upon getting home I was back on the blocky game known by humanity as Minecraft. This time I also got my sister Finley to play. I added a new section onto my map albeit it still needs to take form. Still working on level two unfortunately. I made a new world for Finley to experiment around on and taught her about the basics of Immersive Portals. It was enjoyable. Other than that I learnt a bit about brainfuck. Also played trash pandas where I came out on top by a considerable amount.
