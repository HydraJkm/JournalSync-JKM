My life feels really boring. I do nothing all day, and it only gives immediate satisfaction but nothing else. I would say ever feel like this yourself, but ultimately the only one who should be reading this is me. All I did today was play VR again. I was planning to play hardcore minecraft, but never got around to it. Luckily, I and my sister played actual games today. Namely, Vader Immortal. It is pretty, and better than the demos, but it lacks good gameplay. It's somewhat fun to mess around with a lightsaber, but due to the linearity of the game, and lack of many mechanics probably partly due to the lack of any analog sticks on the controllers, it falls quite short. Another game, that only I played whilst Finley was at a back to school thing, was Blood and Truth. This game had stunning visuals and you could tinker with a lot of very unnecessary details, specifically in cars. It has smoother movement than Vader Immortal and also fairly good gameplay. It is linear, like I said before, it may be a byproduct of the lack of control stick or even directional-pad on the move controllers. It is a first person shooter so everything feels filled with action. That was practically it, but tomorrow I signed up to help with streaming on Toki Pona day.
