Hippopotamus, why are you looking at me like that?
Okay, today (fuck I need to find out how to open better) I did nothing but waste time playing a free vr game on the playstation four we bought for $125 dollars, briefly addressed in yesterday's log. It started swimmingly. We quickly got past the many minigames after learning the basics of what to do. We failed by first starting with the most boring and mediocre one with a claw machine. Then, we left and went to a platformer.  After that, a game where you had to describe the position of ghosts. Then a similar one but wild-west themed. Finally, a shooter and one where on person was a monster and the second had to run. Also there was a cat one too. Also, my father had a dental appointment in the morning. Finley fell after running into her toy box but left with only a bruise luckily. That's about it.
