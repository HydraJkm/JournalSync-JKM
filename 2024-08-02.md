Unfortunately, this month's logs may have peaked yesterday. At least compared to today. All I really did today was sit in a car whilst my mother drove to Seattle, That was about it, but it'd be a shame to end this log here so I will go more into the details I remember. I didn't have as much of a morning as I would have preferred, because my mother prioritised going early to avoid traffic and heat. I tried to use Netpass on my n2dsxl but it wouldn't work. I also learnt a bit about interpreters because I want to create an esolang called Tangled Input/Output lists. I swam but that was about it. I also had fish and chips for diner.
