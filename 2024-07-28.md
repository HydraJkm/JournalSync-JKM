Imagine what happened yesterday, but it happened today. That was pretty much it. Let's start at wake. I decided to wale quickly to get the couch. Little did I know I never had to do this because Finley wanted to get up much, much later. I tried installing Hyprland after installing YaY, but while installing the dependencies, an unfortunate input/output error occurred. I am well accustomed. Typically turning the system on/off again works. Maybe this is a mere work around and I should find the root problem, but it works. The reason why this time it sucked so much is because it happened while installing files. This means that upon reboot, and trying to reinstall the dependencies, I would get many /foo/bar/blah.so exists in filesystem errors. Oh yeah, and Links is a poorly documented browser that wasted my time. I also tried playing Minecraft. After trying to turn the mod into a datapack, the bastard still refused to work. This is fine considering it isn't necessary, and I can do all of its uses by just typing and moving a text cursor around. The datapack may even take longer and more clicks and such to do, but the initial idea was it would just be embedded into the games actual files. I pressed on. I am now trying to make a non-euclidian minecraft map without the use of mods, just good old datapacks and resourcepacks, which can be embedded directly into the world folder, meaning without doing anything too gnarly, it looks very flush and magical. First I had to get the datapack working. This was surprisingly difficult because any fault in anything would make it fail to work. Next up was slowing the items down. Essentially I want you to right click an item to make it teleport you. Unfortunately, this will teleport you once sometimes, twice other times, and if you hold it, infinite times. I'm honestly okay with the last one. The single click turning into two teleports I was not okay with. Solution, create a scoreboard timer. By incrementing a score and reseting it, but before resetting it you do something, you can slow down the items activation rate. This, however, makes the items feel janky. My new solution that I have yet to implement is to make it activate once, and the detect when released to allow another activation. This will hopefully make it feel much smoother. That was about all I wasted my day on today, so onto statistics.
- Statistics:
	- Money: no change
	- Health:
		- 407 steps .2 miles
		- 7h9m screentime (4h25m youtube, 30m obsidian, 2h2m opera, 1h geometry dash)
		- No shower
		- Brushed
		- No biking
	- Added Knowledge:
		- Datapack shit
		- SNBT stands for stringified nbt
	- Thoughts:
		- Have generations in an office setting where those generations are based on chess games.
	- Summary:
		- Didn't do much. I did fuck up arch again. Wasted my time on it too. Than I wasted my time on a datapack to add a single preset into minecraft. Also failed at that. Started making a minecraft map but most of it is messing around with datapacks and components.
