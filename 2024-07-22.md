Another day, more time of my life wasted. Today, to start I played with my sister. Created a nice little house in Minecraft too. After that I played Bayonetta 3 more. Unlocked the train, sucked at doing loops, and a new weopon. Apparently there are sometimes multiple light pillars too, so now I'm scared I'm scared I'm missing a bunch in other chapters (as I'm writing this I found out how much of an idiot I am, light pillars are considered verses and I try to find all verses). More about the house, it was a pretty basic house, better described as a cottage. It had a flat roof and wooden supports. It also had an orange sofa and a tv made of sparkly wool. Not much more to describe than that. Also finally got the call from Velocity.
