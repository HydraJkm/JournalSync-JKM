Time for another log. Last time I was actually enjoying writing in the log so it was quite long, unfortunately that means this one will pale in comparison. Doesn't help that nothing happened. I would instead Arch but that read only mount is really annoying and I don't want to put in the effort to do anything. Also, because of the daunting task and because I need to update Ubuntu, I haven't been using my computer much and instead opting to throw my days into the gutter. This may or may not change tomorrow though, because I have to go to school. I've already gone on about the lows of school on [[2024-08-01]], so no need to continue.
