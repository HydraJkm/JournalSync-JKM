Today was wasted on many things. First off, my dad had a dental appointment. Then, we went to a bunch of stores. By the time I got home it was already 14:00 if not more. It's a shame, but not like I had a choice. Whilst at the dentist, I read about CNC machine tapes. Kinda interesting, but in all reality it's just binary. Also cut onions, but like a lot of fucking onions. My dad cut more too. We're doing a bunch of experiments with them. Not much else.
