Twelve ==

Today we visited the Idaho History Museum. It had barely changed from what I remembered which, while exploring, was a surprising amount. We failed at origami (damn step 3, 4, and 5), read quotes about a fire, did some other things, and learnt a bit about history. There was a lot but it is difficult to describe so I will summarise it akin to what I did 2 days ago on the $19^{th}$:
> Go in
> Pay money
> Go downstairs immediately
> Learn about *somewhat* interesting people
> Have Finley play in blockroom
> Make a fictional old house
> Learn about more stuff
> Do some other things
> Have Finley play in train
> Go upstairs
> Mess with river simulation
> Learn about Native Americans
> Fail at origami
> Learn about big fire
> Learn about borders
> Go home

That was about it. I know it is very generic and boring, but it's 23:27 at the moment so I think it's justified. Not like most of these Journal entries go into excruciating detail anyway. This is already much longer than most and since the rest of my day is just watching shorts I will stop now.
