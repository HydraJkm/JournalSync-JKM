I messed around with Hyprland's config. Nothing else to state about my life. Remember when I said suno pi toki pona was tomorrow, yeah it's happening in thirty minutes from now, 10:01 PM/23:01. Wild innit. It's really frantic and fun to watch. The morning was also frantic because my mother has a party she was not prepared for.
