Log entry #01 -

General summer day. Not much happened, other than got around $200 of free wine making stuff. Delivered lunch to Momma. Most notable thing was the ramble to and from WinCo. That being, Human triathlon. *What in the deep corner of fucking hell does that mean, triathlons are already participated by humans*, is a valid question from just that knowledge. The idea is the is a human and a human jockey. The human jockey rides the human, who is wearing dark sunglasses making his sight akin to that of the Minecraft blindness effect (which doesn't make you completely blind but rather restricts your vision to a few meters out). The sports would be running, swimming, and wrestling (as biking would be confusing and too dangerous). Life went as expected, albeit we never got around to biking. Additionally finally seemed to get Arch Linux to work. Not sure what to add. Days are getting repetitive and seem to smear together. One day after the other, another after that, etc. I'll finish by adding general statistics, to feed into the already overall theme of this being a log you'ld find in a post-apocalyptic game.

- Statistics *i guess?* :
	- Money:
		- Idk, around 200-300 probably
	- Health/Hygiene
		- Pretty good, didn't have a shower (granted I normally wouldn't after a previous shower day)
		- Didn't do morning brush, wine getting hogged the time and never did it.
		- Never biked
		- 1659 steps (.7 Miles)
		- 5h13m screen time
	- Probably more in the future
