Imagine what happened two days ago, and yesterday, but it happened today. Starting to see a pattern? Btw today's a Monday, just to add some weekday reference to this without having to check a calendar. Now onto the journaling stuff again. The most notable thing I did today was implementing the clicking system I talked about at the end of yesterday's log, granted it's just changing more zeros to ones and ones to zeros. Then again, that's all this is too. There wasn't much to it, just constantly increase and subtract a scoreboard, and if it's at zero allow teleporting. Made a tiny bit of progress. Also wanted to make a mob torture chamber but turns out that's really difficult. That was honestly it.
