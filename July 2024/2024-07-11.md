Log entry #2 -

Started today by picking fruit. Cherries, plums, and mulberries more specifically. There were also peaches and pie-cherries but we never got to them. We met a nice woman named Barbara who is selling her house because of rough personal reasons while picking the fruit. We also juiced said fruit, which was fun. We essentially just stuck it directly into the juicer without seeding and let the seed fly out. It made quite a mess unfortunately. I got Awesomewm but it uses `/root` instead of my home directory. Barely any configuration was made because of it. Stil no biking unfortunately. This also means no Minecraft progress on `World Of`, which is a shame. Overall the day flew by. My dad also started curating the process of wine making.
On the other hand, on the night before today I had the idea of making a book. Namely, a person finds seeds from the Aztecs on a wrecked ship underwater leading to a new age of plants. Then another person has to bring back technology such as phone and computers.
