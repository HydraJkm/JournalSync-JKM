Today... I really need to get better at openings. Let's start with highs and lows. High: not much. Lows: Learnt I can't use my computer as a monitor for the switch, it's a Tuesday meaning I had to go places, I had to go to the gymnastics place because my father got hurt my me and more recently the cat, and finally a piece of lint got lodged in my phones port. Luckily my father got it out after my countless attempts to with a nozzle cleaner for the 3d printer. Otherwise this log would be on my 3ds. The grand majority of this day was wasted on YT shorts. Went on a 'stealth mission' to 'steal' the Nintendo switch dock. Didn't connect to my computer as I was hoping unfortunately. While at Wings I messed around with the bash prompt in iSH/Alpine. Figured out how to circumvent... shit my dad texted me, wtf do I do... ah well... my way into getting a bash prompt had a lowerline with info and an upperline which is the part you actually type in. Other than that complete mediocrity.
