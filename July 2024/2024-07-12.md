Another day another note. Figured out why awesomewm wanted to use the `/root/.config` as apposed to my user home. Also *fixed* startx. More about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/awesomewm/s/cSFK9qo5mM). That was barely any though, as for the grand majority of the day I played with my cousins. We swam twice (tried to split gage in while doing as such). We also played Gussy Gurillas. I won once, jack won twice. I got 54 on my first round, 50 on my second, and 44 on my third. I also played (and watched) Fortnight prop hunt.
