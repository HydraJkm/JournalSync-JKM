Reinstalled Arch today. Ly is finally working. Also customised my bash prompt. Chose to try to install Hyprland, but yay and panu both hate me. Also figured out you needed dependencies. This is primarily what I did today. Went to Ace Hardware for 20 minutes against my will. And yet I can't do anything about it because I'm a child. Also tried to find a cave. Died with the Diamond Pickaxe and a Bow-Bow around `1600,-500`. Ate a bit of salt water taffy. Once again, I find my memory falling short. Or the day just sucked. Who knows.
