Log entry 21 -
I woke up. This was indifferent from my normal wake. That is, there was near no variety and the variety that did exist was minuscule enough to be insignificant entirely. Following such, I had gotten my computer, essentially signalling another unappealing and mediocre day. As you could likely imagine, I spent my day on minecraft. Even more humiliating, the thing I was working on never actually managed to succeed meaning today was absolutely rubbish with practically no return. Well, that is until later, which I will mention soon. What I mainly did in minecraft was math. That is, trying to rotate coordinates. I may or may not add an image here eventually:. Figured out about a lot of math in minecraft. This was about it on the minecraft side of things. Now is later. The other half of today goes as such, go and get a ps4 and psvr set. Mow lawn at grandparents house. Deliver Finley to where is necessary. Go back to finish mowing. Set up psvr. And finally set up playstation accounts. Then, I find myself here writing this journal entry.
