Another day another note. Oh wait I've said that already dammit. It was *(LoZ item theme plays)* another day of school! This time we actually did things. In math we learnt another fucking acronym to never use and inevitably forget. This time it's CASE. Guess what it means future me, cause I'm not one to make other people suffer alongside with me. In Science we graphed things and my group was just quicker at them. English we failed to identify the murderer, Mr. Owens. Despite if it was me only I probably may have gotten it right. We wrote a tiny insignificant participation paper for history. Advisory and IDLA 1 we played silent ball, and in IDLA 2 I gave some children some existential crisis (as everyone does). Nothing happened at home for the third day in a row and now I'm here.
