Let's just immediately get started, first I got breakfast from the hotel, still in Washington btw. Had a lot of potatoes and Momma had ~~yogurt~~ Sour-creme she thought was yogurt. Next, we got dressed and went out. During going to Seattle, we went on a bridge going over the sound river and through two tunnels. Afterwards, we found parking and continued to the Pacific Science Center. It mainly consisted of small little booths so instead of saying all of them, I will break it down into a bullet point tree structure like the statistics section:
- Sound area
	- Laser harp
		- Self explanatory, harps with lasers instead of strings
	- Singing bowls
		- Also pretty self explanatory, bowls you hit with something to make them 'sing'
	- Ball track
		- Add small pieces of metal onto a path a ball will follow and hit to make sound.
	- Peg track
		- Cylinder where the surface area is filled with holes you can put magnetic pins in which, when spun, will hit tunes pieces of metal making noise
	- Metronome vibration thing
		- Move a vibrating/swaying long plate to make different temps and pitches
	- Massive guitar
		- Just a really big guitar you can walk into
	- Sound wave visualiser
		- Visualise sound waves by rotating a circle similar to that of the Twister's at Wahooz in Idaho
		- Falling all baord
			- Tilt a plate to make balls fall on different things
- Physics area
	- Heavy weight on a pulley so you can lift it. You can also move the point of the pulley to make it harder.
	- More pulleys
		- Test out different types of pulleys to see which ones are easier to lift objects with
	- Bubble wall
		- Make a big bubble wall and blow bubbles
	-  Butterflies
		- Just your run of the mill butterfly area: similar to Boise zoo's.
	- Mirrors
		- Contort your body in the use of weird was with mirrors
- Play area
	- Clay
		- Play with clay
	- Legos
		- Play with legos
- Space area
	- Planet scale
		- Weigh yourself on different planets
	- Meteorite
		- Feel a meteorite
Those are a few I remember. Then we went to MoPop. We first went to the fantasy section. Then spent a lot of time in the music lab. Then went to SciFi and guitar gallery. After that we went into the space needle which was fairly tall. ![[IMG_1623.jpeg]] Then we swam and now I'm here.
