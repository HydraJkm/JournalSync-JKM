Today was a school day. This should typically result in more things to say, but as today was the first school day technically, it was all expectations most have already learnt. Doubt saying then each year changes anything though. Got home and did nothing. There is not much to say. I think I will like these teachers more than my previous ones, they seem more laid back, in a good way.
