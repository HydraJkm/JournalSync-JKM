My day mainly consisted of doing random shit on my computer. I tried my hand at an esoteric programming language known as chef, and it's quite weird. Essentially it's made to look like a cooking recipe. That is you define things as ingredients and before doing most things you have to 'Put *ingredient* into the *nth* mixing pot.' and sometimes recursively make caramel sauce. That is, make caramel sauce using previous caramel sauce I kid you fucking not. This results in a lot of caramel sauce, but this only 'Serves 1.' I also made some text in brainfuck and decided how to make if statements in Tangled Input/Output Lists. There are two forms, inline if statements and keyword defined if statements. Keyword defined if statements are easier so I'll describe those first. Essentially, use keyword 'if' and have the input be the condition '{in=#INEQU{#INTVAL{1} = \#INTVAL{2}},' and the output be some function defined previously (or an immediate function weirdo) 'out=#IMFUNC{put {in=#STRING{"Hello World!"},out=%CONS}}}'. This prints Hello World! to the console if 1 equals 2. There is no elif or else in this example. Inline if statements are more suited for defining an input or output without multiple lines. Like before, let's make a keyword i/o pair that outputs Hello World to the console if 1 equals 2. We will use the put command to put a string in the console. 'put {in=,out=}'. There are two ways we could do this. Way 1 utilities only the immediate if, way 2 utilises the immediate if and the immediate then partner. Way 1: 'put {in=#if{#INEQU{#INTVAL{1} = \#INTVAL{2}},#STRING{"Hello World!"}},out=%CONS}', way 2: 'put {in=#IF{#INEQU{#INTVAL{1} = \#INTVAL{2}},#STRING{"Hello World!"}},out=#THEN{%CONS}}'. Technically you could do the first method but with the output being iffed instead of or and the input. Both will return nothing if the check fails, which it will because 1 â‰  2. This may be unideal, but I'll explain elses and elifs once I have more time to think about it. Also my grandparents have another leak but this one is before the house. This means we either have to contact the city, or do something potentially illegal to turn it off. Also the trucks battery dies so that's great too.
