Today I fell asleep (possibly multiple times) in the morning. I watched Finley play the Spring-a-majig map for the thousandth time in the morning but I also theoretically watch Transformers. I also finally ordered Bayonetta 3 for 37.03 dollars. Hypothetically it will arrive tomorrow but it also said on Thursday so who the hell knows. Got a free kegerator today too. Wanted to find a cave in Minecraft but didn't bike because my Fathers swollen finger (which may or may not be my fault (on accident) two days ago). Thus nothing happened. Played with my sister. Not much else, even though I wish to report about more.
