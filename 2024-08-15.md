Continuing my streak of doing nothing, I went to school. You can imagine what happened from the last day. The only substantial difference is we are doing a murder mystery project in English/ELA. The story is pretty normal. Got a house from a family member, turns out it's a run down manor, there is a ghost, you have to figure out who turned the ghost into a ghost. We did a Blooket in Advisory and did games in IDLA. Got home and did nothing.
