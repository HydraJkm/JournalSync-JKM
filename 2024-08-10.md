Ten days into the month of August and it's a bit weird to think my birthday is only 14 days away, and unlike younger children, I have no wants or desires. Nothing of much interest occurred at day. To my knowledge, suno pi toki pona is running great and all I did was go to a store many times whilst my father runs errands back and forth trying (and ultimately failing) to fix plumbing at my grandparents' house. I learnt some more toki pona too. I also deleted some things to hopefully make room for an actual Arch Linux partition on my nvme instead of a flimsy usb drive that fails every 30ish minutes. Since the plumbing took I more than 4 hours of my day, there's not much to say.
