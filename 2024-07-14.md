Today was a day full of everything and yet so little. Not to be poetic, of course. The only way to describe this day is to play it back. Starting at wake, I wanted to go back to bed. The morning was calm. I had cereal for breakfast and got through a galaxy or two in Mario Galaxy. We finished watch Transformers and started watching a weird 3d-ish one. I watched shorts for a while, and biked 9.1 miles. Almost finished my chiseled booksheld combination lock. Only thing is the reset button locks the repeaters in the on state, leading to none of the copper bulbs changing states. My father and I went to obtain a free wine fridge but it was burnt and instead ended up with a microwave, calculator, and Minecraft torch of all things. Been wanting Bayonetta 3 today, planned to go to VIP game shop but it was closed and everything else didn't have it or was closed. I also played with a balloon with my dad and sister.
