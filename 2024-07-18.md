Did some fucking around and got Hyprland working. Turns out programs are dependent on dependencies. Also, ssh-ing into the archdrive to use bash wildcard worked to rid of the bad yay packages, so it's working too. Things about using ACS for widgets on Hyprland. Still need to config it. Got Bayonetta 3, didn't start playing it though. Went to the store reluctantly and accidentally rammed my father with a cart. Made cheese but with powdered dextrose as opposed to citric acid (also on accident). Finley got her claw machine too. Life's getting more boring, but hey at least the food's good. Also learnt how to sous vide things.
