Started the day off hot with creating a notes overview network for my journal, found here: [[Overview Network.canvas|Overview Network]]. Looking forward to adding this note to it. Other than that the day was pretty mediocre. I did bike however. I did a lot of fishing and that's about it. I also began messing with Arch again. Firstly, the reason why the partition was only read was because the Linux command dd changed the ext4 filesystem to an iso one, and iso file systems are meant to be read only as found out many days past. After formatting to ext4, I installed Arch and for once everything went perfectly fine. Except now I need it to show up in GRUB (GRand Universal Bootloader). *Can't be too hard* I thought to myself incorrectly. First, I changed the config generate to include os-prober, and ran `update-grub` to update the config. It failed because the esp didn't have enough space. Simple fix right? Wrong. Gparted refuses to resize it. The solution? Copy the contents of the esp to a different location, delete the esp and all of its files, hope the backup works (if it doesn't have fun, your system may be screwed, not boot, and require a recovery flash drive to boot anything), and finally, you have resized your esp. That is If you did change the size, which you did do right. Then I installed GRUB (again) made a new config. About everything and even now it still doesn't work. I can still boot Ubuntu and Windows luckily. Still no Arch though.
