As said previously, I drove home from Washington today. Because of such, and it was the trip back and not to, I have not much to say. Luckily, I am back in my bed so I am able to journal comfortably, and I spent all day sitting in a car meaning I am not the most tired. We listened to Hamilton: The Broadcast all the way home. I also now have a burning desire to create resin dice because of Youtube. We ate McDonald's for lunch and tacos for dinner. When we got home, I went to Walmart, Home Depot, and Winco. That was practically my day.
