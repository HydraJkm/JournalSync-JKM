It's a new month, you know what that means! A blank slate. Wait, no, that's a year. I guess all it really means is that time has passed and I am one step closer to eternal doom, ah well, eternal doom will be nice I suppose. Back on topic, I, and my sister, played more PSVR, as you do when you get a new VR set. Only makes sense that you'd want to play VR games until the novelty of it all inevitably runs dry. Obviously we started by playing the demo we were looking forward to (specifically my sister)... Job Simulator! As fun as the actual game may be, the demo was surprisingly mediocre. It showed off barely anything except that playing it would be slightly funner than watching it on a 2-Dimensional screen. It also probably doesn't help that I've watched the full game be played many times. After that, I and my sister played another mediocre demo, this time of a puzzle game that A- simply fell short B- was to linear C- was too short literally and D- would be more enjoyable as a normal non vr game. Then, we started going wherever we felt like in terms of playing demos. In my personal opinion, which is of course a redundant statement because an opinion already implies it's what you personally think, the best demo we played was an unassuming demo of a game called Dino Frontier. They gave us a generous time limit for the demo and was smooth and felt relatively good to control. It also wasn't lacking in content, especially compared to the other demos. Granted, it seemed like a sandbox game, which means it may just be minecraft bias showing or something. Some other notable ones I played were Fantastic Contraptions and Moss. Some good ones in terms of just breath taking visuals were a tank one starting with battle, and the persistence, but I should probably stop talking about games before I just list every demo in the compound. We also showed Momma the one Godzilla minigame from the playroom vr. Apparently we are going to Seattle tomorrow, which is both a blessing and a curse. What do I mean? Well, first the car ride, them I'll have to go a bunch of places and wall a bunch too, and this also marks the final week of summer break, essentially meaning I lose time to do what I want, and also have to slay the bastard of a beast which is doing something, when I'd prefer to do something else. Also, I have come to recognise that one of the worst parts of school is I want to use all the powerful tools I normally use like Gnu Image Manipulation Program or Bourn Again Shell but simply can't because a bunch of logical reasoning that makes me suffer. Frankly, maybe I'll just bring my home computer to school and say *fuck it, if you want me to work than let me work how I personally want to instead of forcing your weak ass chromebooks onto me.* Alas, I also don't have the balls to do that. I also really don't like the idea of bringing my home computer to a place where it could easily get scratched, broken, or messed with. Granted if I had the balls to say what I did above, I'd also probably have the balls to just force people out of the way of doing anything with my computer. Anyway, that was a *small* ramble about my day.
