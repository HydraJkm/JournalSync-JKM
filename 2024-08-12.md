Let's start off with the lows. Oh wait, this was my entire day. Maybe the highs? Them too? Seme a! Today is a tangled mess of emotions that I don't feel, but certainly can comprehend. I guess I'll do morning down. First I did a school orientation. Was it worth 5 hours of my day? Not really, it's just boring and mediocre. Doesn't make it bad not good, just a waste of time. It's fine, especially compared to the years of wasted time on going to school. I can barely name anything I learnt last year and I doubt that will change this time. The only reason to really go to the orientation is to see the new schedule before doing anything 'important' and collecting your computer. The only other time it's nice is when you first start. Then I went to my grandparents house and helped my dad and grandpa with plumbing issues. Less if a waste of time since it was theoretically actively doing damage to their property, and not having water without minor flooding is not ideal. We went to Lowes twice to get a coupler, and then two more and a pipe. Ultimately, it seemed to succeed but it is missing one barn that's just hanging out. Hopefully it works. Then I got home now here. To artificially extend the time is reading this entry, I will add one sentence of my sisters probably more interesting day. She too went to a school thing but hers may have been more interesting, and hanged out with our cousins/cousin.
