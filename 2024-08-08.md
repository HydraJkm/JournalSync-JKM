Another day another 12 hours wasted. This time mostly on Arch. suno pi toki pona is tomorrow. I got ags and messed around with it but failed miserably at most things I tried. That was about it. I also am trying my luck at getting back into Mature Craft again. I really wish to provide more information but I can't think of anything.
