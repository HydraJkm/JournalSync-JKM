Today I almost forgot to do this, which is a shame considering today was, well, it was certainly a day. Right now I'm fucking around with chess.com custom variants but I played Minecraft after getting my reoccurring dream about going through almost endless amounts of hallways and weird passages while trying to outrun my and my cousins parents for fun. Also biked, did some storage stuff, got more furnaces, and fixed the reset button using a single observer. Played with a balloon with my sister again. Desperately wanted to ask to go to VIP Gamestore but never did. That's about it. Also found my calculator in the *deep caverns of the couch*.
