As much to my dismay, I still do these journal entries, log 18 -
I reluctantly woke up, and that is not an understatement considering I woke up at 10:00 (which is actually the time I prefer to wake up at but my parents prefer 9:00). I went back and tried to get some more coins on brainfugd and also learnt a bit about spwn. Probably about halfway through. Today was quite underwhelming. Normally awakening any later than immediately would result in my agony from the small couch, but today I still obtained the large couch. This was due to my sister going to a birthday party, not her own, but still. Daddy (my literal father, nothing else) was utterly bored but I didn't want to go anywhere. Maybe it would have made this entry more appealing to make, but alas it is too late. Instead I wasted time on trying to make a superflat preset. Tried everything and still didn't work so far. At the end of the day I played another board game and lost by a lot. Also got back to Arch Linux after finding coding on anything not riced boring. That was unfortunately about all I have to comment on.
